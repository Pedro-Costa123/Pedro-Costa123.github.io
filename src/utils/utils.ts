/**
 * workTime Function
 *
 * This function calculates the duration between two dates in years and months.
 * It takes four parameters: startMonth, startYear, endMonth, and endYear.
 *
 * The function creates two Date objects, date1 and date2, representing the start and end dates.
 * If endMonth and endYear are not provided, the current date is used as the end date.
 *
 * The function calculates the time difference between date2 and date1 in milliseconds, then converts this to months.
 * It also calculates the number of years passed by dividing the total months by 12.
 *
 * The function returns a string representing the duration in years and months.
 * If only one month has passed, it returns '1 month'.
 * If less than a year has passed, it returns the number of months followed by 'months'.
 * If a year or more has passed, it returns the number of years followed by 'years' and the remaining number of months followed by 'months'.

/**
 * loadCompanies Function
 *
 * This function creates an array of Company objects from a data object.
 * It takes one parameter: data.

 * The function initializes an empty array, loadedCompanies, to store the Company objects.
 * It loops over the 'jobs' array in the data object, creating a new Company object for each job.
 *
 * For each job, the function creates an array of Job objects from the 'positions' array in the job object.
 * It creates a new Job object for each position, using the properties of the position object.
 *
 * The function pushes the new Job objects to the companyJobs array, then creates a new Company object using the name and logo properties of the job object and the companyJobs array.
 * It pushes the new Company object to the loadedCompanies array.
 *
 * The function returns the loadedCompanies array.
